#### Logo Files
Toolpath Studio has official logos available in two versions (located in the repository at `logos/png/`):
- **Light Background Version**: `logos/png/toolpath-studio-light.png`
  - Use on light or white backgrounds
  - Best for blog posts, social media posts with light backgrounds, and printed materials
- **Dark Background Version**: `logos/png/toolpath-studio-dark.png`
  - Use on dark backgrounds
  - Best for video thumbnails, dark-themed websites, and social media posts with dark backgrounds

#### Logo Usage Guidelines
- Always use the appropriate version (light or dark) based on the background
- Maintain clear space around the logo (minimum padding equal to 10% of logo height on all sides)
- Do not stretch, distort, or alter the logo proportions
- Do not change the logo colors
- Do not add effects (shadows, gradients, etc.) to the logo
- Use the logo at sufficient size to maintain readability (minimum width: 200px for digital)

#### Geometric Shapes and Hexagon Theme
Hexagons are a recurring visual theme throughout the Toolpath Studio environment, from the hexagonal ceiling lights to the hexagon acoustic tiles visible in video backgrounds. When geometric shapes are used to enhance presentations, hexagons should be the preferred choice to maintain visual consistency with the lab aesthetic.

**Hexagon Usage Guidelines:**
- **When to Use**: Incorporate hexagons judiciously when geometric shapes enhance the presentation, such as when creating visual hierarchy, grouping related content, or adding visual interest to otherwise plain backgrounds
  - Video thumbnails and graphics
  - Social media post designs
  - Blog post featured images
  - Presentation slides and overlays
  - Decorative elements in graphics
  - Grid patterns and backgrounds
  - Infographic design elements
- **How to Use**:
  - Use hexagons as subtle background patterns or decorative accents
  - Create hexagonal frames or borders for highlighting content
  - Arrange hexagons in honeycomb patterns for visual interest
  - Scale hexagons appropriately - they should occupy no more than 30-40% of the design area and remain secondary to the main content
  - Maintain consistent hexagon proportions (regular hexagons with equal sides)
  - Use hexagons in brand colors for consistency
- **When NOT to Use**:
  - Don't force hexagons into every design - use them where they add value
  - Avoid using hexagons when they detract from content clarity
  - Don't use so many hexagons that they become distracting
  - Skip hexagons in minimal or text-focused designs where simplicity is key

The hexagon theme helps create a unique, recognizable visual identity while maintaining professionalism and clarity.
