Diagram: Motion System Concept

Description:
A clean, educational diagram illustrating the fundamental components of a motion control system for digital fabrication. The diagram should show:

Main Components:
1. Coordinate System: A 3D Cartesian coordinate system with clearly labeled X, Y, and Z axes shown with arrows and labels.

2. Tool Position: A generic tool head (simplified geometric shape like a cylinder or cone) positioned within the coordinate space.

3. Motion Arrows: Directional arrows showing possible movement along each axis in both positive and negative directions.

4. Work Area: A subtle rectangular boundary representing the machine's working envelope/build volume.

5. Origin Point: Clearly marked origin (0,0,0) with distinctive marker or label.

Additional Elements:
- Call-out boxes or labels explaining:
  - "X-Axis: Left-Right Movement"
  - "Y-Axis: Front-Back Movement"
  - "Z-Axis: Up-Down Movement"
  - "Tool Position: Precisely controlled in 3D space"

- Simple annotation showing example coordinates like (50, 75, 10)

Styling:
- Clean, technical illustration style
- Blue and gray color scheme with accent colors for axes (red=X, green=Y, blue=Z following standard convention)
- Clear, readable sans-serif font for labels
- Minimal shading, emphasis on clarity over realism
- Isometric or 3/4 perspective view to show all three axes clearly
- White or light gray background

Purpose: Help readers visualize the basic 3D coordinate system used by all digital fabrication machines.
