Featured Image: Various Digital Manufacturing Machines

Description:
A horizontal composition featuring five distinct digital manufacturing machines arranged side by side, showcasing the diversity of digital fabrication equipment. The image should include:

1. Pen Plotter (left): A modern XY plotter with a pen holder, drawing on white paper. Show the pen in motion creating geometric patterns.

2. Vinyl Cutter (center-left): A desktop vinyl cutter with a roll of colored vinyl loaded, mid-cut with the blade carriage visible.

3. 3D Printer (center): A Cartesian-style 3D printer with visible XYZ gantry system, actively printing a small object with material extruding.

4. Laser Engraver (center-right): A laser engraving machine with visible laser head, engraving a pattern on a piece of wood. Show the focused laser beam if possible (safety note: represented artistically).

5. CNC Mill (right): A desktop 3-axis CNC mill with spinning cutting bit engaged with a piece of aluminum or plastic material.

Styling:
- Clean, well-lit workshop/makerspace environment
- Professional product photography style
- Each machine should be clearly distinguishable
- Emphasize the motion systems (rails, gantries, carriages) on each machine
- Slight perspective to create depth
- Neutral background that doesn't compete with the machines
- Color palette: industrial grays, blues, and warm workshop lighting

Purpose: Featured image for blog post, demonstrating the variety of digital manufacturing equipment that shares common motion control principles.
