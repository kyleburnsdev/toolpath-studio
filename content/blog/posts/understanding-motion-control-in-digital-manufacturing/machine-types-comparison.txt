# Comparison Chart: Machine Types and Key Considerations

## Purpose: 
Provide at-a-glance comparison of how different machine types operate and what makes each unique despite shared motion control principles.

## Dimensions: 
1600px × 1200px (4:3 landscape ratio for detailed chart)

## Description:
A comprehensive comparison chart/infographic showing the five main digital manufacturing machine types and their key operational characteristics.

## Layout:
Matrix-style chart with machines across the top and characteristics down the left side.

### Column Headers (with icons):
1. Pen Plotter (icon: pen drawing)
2. Vinyl Cutter (icon: blade cutting)
3. 3D Printer (icon: layered object)
4. Laser Engraver (icon: laser beam)
5. CNC Mill (icon: rotating bit)

### Row Categories:

1. Primary Motion:
- Pen Plotter: XY + pen up/down
- Vinyl Cutter: XY + blade pressure
- 3D Printer: XYZ + extrusion
- Laser Engraver: XY + power modulation
- CNC Mill: XYZ + rotational
2. Tool Contact:
- Pen Plotter: Direct (pen touches paper)
- Vinyl Cutter: Direct (blade cuts)
- 3D Printer: Direct (deposits material)
- Laser Engraver: Non-contact (beam)
- CNC Mill: Direct (bit removes material)
3. Material Interaction:
- Pen Plotter: Additive (adds ink)
- Vinyl Cutter: Subtractive (removes cut shape)
- 3D Printer: Additive (builds up)
- Laser Engraver: Subtractive (ablates/burns)
- CNC Mill: Subtractive (cuts away)
4. Speed Range:
- Pen Plotter: Fast (500-2000 mm/min)
- Vinyl Cutter: Medium (300-800 mm/min)
- 3D Printer: Slow-Medium (30-150 mm/min)
- Laser Engraver: Very Fast (1000-10000 mm/min)
- CNC Mill: Variable (100-3000 mm/min)
5. Precision Level:
- Pen Plotter: Medium (±0.1mm)
- Vinyl Cutter: Medium (±0.1mm)
- 3D Printer: Medium-High (±0.05mm)
- Laser Engraver: High (±0.01mm)
- CNC Mill: Very High (±0.001mm)
6. Common Materials:
- Pen Plotter: Paper, cardstock
- Vinyl Cutter: Vinyl, paper, thin materials
- 3D Printer: Plastics, resins
- Laser Engraver: Wood, acrylic, leather, paper
- CNC Mill: Metal, wood, plastic, composites
7. Key Control Parameter:
- Pen Plotter: Pen pressure (Z-axis)
- Vinyl Cutter: Blade depth & force
- 3D Printer: Extrusion rate (E-axis)
- Laser Engraver: Power level (%)
- CNC Mill: Spindle speed (RPM) & depth

## Visual Design:
- Each cell contains concise text or icons
- Color coding by category (e.g., speed uses gradient from slow=red to fast=green) when it is needed to better convey the data
- Icons or small illustrations for each machine type
- Check marks or symbols for yes/no attributes
- Clear grid lines separating cells
- Header row with machine illustrations
- Alternating row colors for readability

## Additional Elements:
- Legend explaining color coding or symbols
- Title at top: "Digital Manufacturing Machines: Key Characteristics"
- Footer note: "Values are approximate and vary by specific model"
