Diagram: Logo to Physical Machine Mapping

Description:
An infographic-style diagram showing how Logo turtle concepts map to real digital fabrication machines. The diagram should be organized in a grid or flow layout:

Structure (4 rows × 3 columns):

Header Row:
- Column 1: "Logo Concept"
- Column 2: "Command"
- Column 3: "Physical Machine Equivalent"

Row 1 - Pen Control:
- Logo: Turtle with pen up/down icon
- Command: "PENUP / PENDOWN"
- Physical: Split image showing:
  - Pen plotter servo raising/lowering pen
  - Laser engraver laser off/on
  - CNC mill spindle engaged/disengaged

Row 2 - Movement:
- Logo: Turtle moving forward with arrow
- Command: "FORWARD 100"
- Physical: Split image showing:
  - Plotter carriage moving along rail
  - 3D printer head translating on gantry
  - CNC mill moving along axis

Row 3 - Positioning:
- Logo: Turtle with coordinate grid
- Command: "SETXY 50 50"
- Physical: Split image showing:
  - Vinyl cutter at specific XY position
  - Laser head positioned over workpiece
  - Mill bit at precise coordinate

Row 4 - Direction:
- Logo: Turtle rotating with angle indicator
- Command: "RIGHT 90"
- Physical: Split image showing:
  - Vector change in toolpath
  - Change in cutting direction
  - Repositioning for next operation

Styling:
- Clean, modern infographic design
- Consistent icon style for Logo elements
- Real machine photos or high-quality illustrations
- Color coding: Logo elements in one color (e.g., teal), physical machines in another (e.g., orange)
- Connecting lines or arrows showing relationships
- Clear, readable labels and command text
- White or light neutral background
- Professional technical publication quality

Purpose: Show direct conceptual mapping between Logo programming concepts and real machine operations.

Dimensions: 1200px × 1400px (vertical orientation to accommodate rows)
