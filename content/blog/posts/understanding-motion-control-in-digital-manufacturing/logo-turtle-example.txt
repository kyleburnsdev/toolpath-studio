Image: Logo Turtle Graphics Example

Description:
A visual representation of Logo turtle graphics showing both the code and its resulting output. The image should be divided into two sections:

Left Side - Code Section:
Display Logo code with syntax highlighting:
```
PENDOWN
REPEAT 4 [
  FORWARD 100
  RIGHT 90
]
PENUP
```

Right Side - Output Section:
Show the turtle graphics canvas with:
- A completed square drawn with a colored line (blue or black)
- The turtle icon (small triangle or arrow) at the final position
- Faint dotted lines showing the path the turtle traveled
- Small arrows along the path indicating direction of movement
- The turtle's initial position marked with a small circle or "Start" label

Additional Visual Elements:
- The four corners of the square should be clearly visible
- Each side should be equal length
- Right angles at each corner
- Clean, crisp lines for the drawn square
- The turtle should be oriented in the direction it's facing (upward after completing the square)

Styling:
- Educational illustration style
- Clean white or light cream background for the canvas area
- Code displayed in a subtle gray code block with monospace font
- Vibrant but not overwhelming color for the drawn line
- The turtle icon should be distinctive and easy to identify
- Labels should be clear and readable
- Professional, textbook-quality appearance

Purpose: Introduce readers to Logo turtle graphics and demonstrate how simple commands create visual output.

Dimensions: 1000px Ã— 500px (2:1 ratio, split between code and output)
